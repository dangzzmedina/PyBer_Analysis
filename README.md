# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

* The purpose of Module 5 Challenge was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data and make a visualization for our analysis. We started by grouping and filtering our information to see how the the sum of fares(our value) changed during our specified time frame by using date and city type as our indexes. We were able to show a plot graph at the end of the Module Challenge to reflect our analysis.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

* Images attached to the repository. When we look at our plot graph, we identify the Urban city type by having the most sum of fares compared with the rural and suburban city types. This could be due to the amount of demand of individuals needing rides in the urban area compared to the suburbs and rural cities. The urban cities have increases starting January and slowing back on May. But, the suburbs do have an increase at the end of May, possibly meaning that summer might increase the flow of tourism in the suburb areas. The rural city types are the least impacted. This could possibly be due to low demand on rural city types.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

* 1. The first recommendation I would address to the CEO is that we should look for an analysis on the mean of driver counts per city type. By taking a quick glimpse to certain urban cities, driver counts are low, so doing this analysis could help us better understand which cities are falling behind with number of drivers. That way the company could incentivize the geographical location to hire more drivers. Eventually, it will lead to an increase in revenue as the demand in urban cities are high. In the other hand, rural and suburban cities have less than half of rides than urban cities combined. Analyzing the mean of driver counts(as the value) with date and type(as the indexes), could give us great information on when do drivers are busy in their city types.

* 2. The second recommendation I would address to the CEO is to incentivize drivers in the urban area early summer. This would bring more drivers to the streets and increase revenue for the ride-sharing company. The reason I recommend this, is because Urban areas normally receive more tourism to the city.

* 3. The third recommendation I would address to the CEO is that we should be analyzing a whisker box analysis to determine if any outliers exist and get a better understanding of our fare sum by city type. For example, urban average fare per ride is around $24 USD. If there are any outliers, maybe the fare per ride could be higher than the target rate and we don't even know it. Therefore we could have a big impact on demand. We should incentivize taking out outliers to find the maximum equilibrium for the company.
